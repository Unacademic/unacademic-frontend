title: Prevent Wheel Reinvention
curator: Reika Chavers

summary: learn to curate like a boss in Unacademic

description: |
  How many wheels have you had to reinvent already? Our guess would be 'too
  many'. Somehow, we keep creating new textbooks and courses, but most
  information is out there already. You just need a set up that organizes the
  this knowledge in one place, with just the right amount of structure. You
  don’t want to be told what to learn, but you don’t want to figure it out
  from scratch either. So gather those interesting blog posts, podcasts, or
  tutorials, add your comments, and share them. That’s it!

  - title: Structure your Story
    description: |
      Learning and curation on unacademic is built around waypoints. Think of
      them as narratives. And like every good story, they need a structure: a
      beginning, an end, and several other exciting events in between them.

      Events in unacademic are called checkpoints. As a curator, you use them
      to contextualize the resources that you want to share with others.Learners
      use checkpoints to track their progress within your story.

      People tend to be more motivated in their learning when its a story,
      so create and curate your waypoints accordingly.
