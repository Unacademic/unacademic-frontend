  While in theory, you could hardcode everything in HTML this becomes
  cumbersome quite rapidly. Computers are made to automate boring, difficult,
  error-prone, and repetitive tasks, so let's use that potential to the
  fullest.

  - title: Climb Trees
    description: |
      The paperless office is an eternal promise that the computer has yet to
      fulfill. Still, it has managed to save the forests in a different way. In
      fact, tree-like structures are everywhere in programming. For instance, in
      the form of ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) and the branches you use in git.

      When dealing with the web in general, and browsers in particular, the
      DOM (Document Object Model) is probably the most important tree that you
      will encounter. It is the underlying structure of all the different
      elements and properties that a webpage consists of.

        The easiest way to explore the DOM is through the developer console in
        your browser. The console is also an invaluable tool while testing and
        debugging your code, so take your time to familiarize yourself with i

  - title: Manipulate Documents
    description: |
      CSS not only offers us a convenient way to style our documents, it
      also provides us with some great abstractions to query them. It is
      therefore not a coincident that we use many of the same abstractions when
      we want to deal with documents programmatically.

      While JavaScript has always offered interfaces to query and manipulate
      the DOM, dealing with incompatibilities between browsers used to be a
      huge pain. So much so actually, that jQuery - a library that abstracts a
      lot of the differences between browsers behind a common interface - became
      the de facto standard to deal with HTML documents programmatically.

      With the introduction of evergreen browsers, however, traversing
      and manipulating the DOM with plain javascript has actually become very
      simple. So let's go native!

  - title: Make Templates
    description: |
      Templating is another, and arguably better, way to solve the problem of
      writing the same markup over and over again. Since the template contains
      all the elements that stay the same from document from document, it allows
      you to focus on the parts that change. These so-called variables then
      need to be injected into the templates.

      Also, while you may appreciate this right now, t is important to
      notice that templates make it possible not to manipulate the DOM directly,
      This greatly reduces the chance that you run into bugs - either your own,
      or those of others - and ensure a clearer separation of concerns.

      There are many different solutions for templating available (erb, jade,
      handlebars, etc.) partly due to the fact that - until recently - this was
      not possible to do natively in HTML.

      In the latest versions of the HTML specification, this has changed
      though. And the most recent iterations of browsers now all support
      templates. So, again, let's not use a proprietary solution but use a native
      alternative instead.

    description: |
      A template without data is not worth much. Information, however, comes
      in many shapes and forms: texts, numbers, sounds, images, etc. In order to
      store, manipulate, and transmit this plethora of data, computer languages
      differentiate between basic types. These types are called data structures.'

        Familiarize yourself with the basic data structures in JavaScript:
        strings, booleans, numbers. If you are curious about more complex and
        exotic data structures have a look at the wikipedia list or go straight
        to haskell...

      The final task for this section, is that you make a fork of this
      document. You can structure and style your document whichever way you like
      to. There are two restrictions, however.

      1. Your fork describes the next session - with the title *Practice Best Practices*
      2. Don't hardcode your data, use a template instead.

      If you need inspiration for tasks and/or resources. You can have
      a look at the [syllabus](http://ast.codingthehumanities.com/)
      of last year's of this course, or at the
      [website](http://coding-the-humanities.github.io/unacademic_static/)
