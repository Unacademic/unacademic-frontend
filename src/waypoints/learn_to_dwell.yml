description: |
  Learning is a process of constant negotiation with content
  and with people. It’s about being wrong AND right.
  About learning AND teaching. You learn best from your mistakes
  and in collaboration with others. So welcome failure,
  share your work when you’re in the middle, and engage.
  Don’t follow a straight trajectory, but explore.
  Embrace a new style of learning by learning to dwell.

  - title: Love Being Wrong
    introduction: |
      What does being wrong feels like? If anything,
      like being right. It’s realizing you’re wrong
      that feels horrible. But being wrong is human.
      We’re wrong 50% of the time, we just don’t know which 50%.
      Start loving to be wrong.

    instructions:
        - watch these movies and learn about the science behind being wrong

      to improve your projects.
